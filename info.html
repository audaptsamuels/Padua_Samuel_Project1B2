        AUDAPT SAMUELS IS AN EXPERIENCED YET UNKOWN ARTIST OUT OF puerto rico, AND miami. HIS SHIT BUMPS AND ITS FOWL, FUNNY, AND SmART ASSeD. IT SLAPS IN THE WHIP. My mother died at a young age and it has left a hunger for success in young sam that will be satisfied one day. Even though I was never poor I've seen a lot and been through a lot which influences the sound and messages in RAUNCHY music.  I talk a lot about doing THE NASTIES a lot too; (How I like to do it not that I do a lot). Im not lying to anybody.
